This guide will show you how to set up Tina in a NextJS environment.

## Bootstrapping

Unlike Gatsby, NextJS does not currently have a plugin system, so a small amount of bootstrapping needs to be done. Refer to the guides on [bootstrapping](/docs/nextjs/bootstrapping) and [adding a backend](/docs/nextjs/adding-backends) for information on how to set things up.
