When teams are editing a site with TinaCMS, typically a **cloud editing environment** with TinaCMS be hosted somewhere (so that editors do not need to install the site in a local development environment).

Tina Teams adds user management features on top of sites running TinaCMS in the cloud. Tina Teams is currently in [closed beta](/teams 'Tina Teams Signup').

Interaction with Tina Teams' environments is performed through the [Tina CLI](/docs/teams/cli/introduction 'Tina CLI').
