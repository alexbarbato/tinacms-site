When it's time to get your editors editing a TinaCMS site, you will likely want to setup a **cloud editing environment** so that editors can edit the site's content from the cloud. The **cloud editing environment** is separate from your production site. It is a staging environment which runs your site in dev mode, in which TinaCMS will be accesible.

Once a cloud editing environment has been setup for your site, **Tina Teams** can be used to manage which users can access the **cloud editing environment**.
Interaction with Tina Teams is performed through the [Tina CLI](/docs/teams/cli/introduction 'Tina CLI').
